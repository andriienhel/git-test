me like steak and summer sunset
and i too very like pretty kitties
and i love my dear Vikulechka
and it everything about her!
but and not only it...
she it has beautiful eyes!

I look in window and view night sky
and Moon now. More I hear power wind.

Today, I walked to street, eat ice cream 
and drink iced-tea with raspberry.
