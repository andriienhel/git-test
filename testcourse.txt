me like steak and summer sunset
and i too very like pretty kitties
and i love my dear Vikulechka
and it everything about her!
but and not only it...
she it has beautiful eyes!

I look in window and view night sky
and Moon now. More I hear power wind.
Today, I has walked to street,
went to supermarket and buyed apple juice.
